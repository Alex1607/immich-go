# Bulk Uploading to Immich with `immich-go`

Do you have a large collection of photos or extensive Google Photos takeout files to upload in 'immich'?<br>
Are you struggling with Node.js or Docker installation just to upload your photos to 'immich'?

Give a try to the `immich-go` tool.

- import from folder(s).
- import from zipped archives without prior extraction.
- discard duplicate images, based on the file name, and the date of capture.
- import only missing files or better files (an delete the inferior copy from the server).
- import from Google Photos takeout archives:
    - use metadata to bypass file name discrepancies in the archive
    - use metadata to get album real names
    - use date of capture found in the json files
    - create albums based on Google Photos albums or folder names.
- import photos taken within a date range.
- remove duplicated assets, based on the file name, date of capture, and file size
- no installation, no dependencies.

⚠️ This an early version, not yet extensively tested<br>
⚠️ Keep a backup copy of your files for safety<br>


For insights into the reasoning behind this alternative to `immich-cli`, please refer to the [Motivation](docs/motivation.md) section below.


# Executing `immich-go`
The `immich-go` program uses the Immich API. Hence it need the server address and a valid API key.


```sh
immich-go -server URL -key KEY -general_options COMMAND -command_options... {files}
```

`-server URL` URL of the Immich service, example http://<your-ip>:2283 or https://your-domain<br>
`-key KEY` A key generated by the user. Uploaded photos will belong to the key's owner.<br>
`-no-colors-log` Remove color codes from logs.<br>
`-log-level` Adjust the log verbosity as follow: (Default OK)
- `ERROR`: Display only errors
- `WARNING`: Same as previous one plus non blocking error
- `OK`: Same as previous plus actions
- `INFO`: Same as previous one plus progressions


## Command `upload`

Use this command for uploading photos and videos from a local directory, a zipped folder or all zip files that google photo takeout procedure has generated.

### Switches and options:
`-album "ALBUM NAME"` Import assets into the Immich album `ALBUM NAME`.<br>
`-device-uuid VALUE` Force the device identification (default $HOSTNAME).<br>
`-dry-run` Preview all actions as they would be done.<br> 
`-delete` Delete local assets after successful upload. <br>
`-create-album-folder <bool>` Generate immich albums after folder names.<br>
`-force-sidecar <bool>` Force sending a .xmp sidecar file beside images. With Google photos date and GPS coordinates are taken from metadata.json files. (default: FALSE).<br>


### Date selection:
Fine-tune import based on specific dates:<br>
`-date YYYY-MM-DD` import photos taken on a particular day.<br>
`-date YYYY-MM` select photos taken during a particular month.<br>
`-date YYYY` select photos taken during a particular year.<br>
`-date YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD` select photos taken within this date range.<br>

### Google photos options:

Specialized options for Google Photos management:
`-google-photos` import from a Google Photos structured archive, recreating corresponding albums.<br>
`-from-album "GP Album"` Create the album in `immich` and import album's assets.<br>
`-create-albums <bool>`  Controls creation of Google Photos albums in Immich (default TRUE). <br>
`-keep-untitled-albums <bool>` Untitled albums are imported into `immich` whit the name of the folder as title.<br>
`-keep-partner <bool>` Specifies inclusion or exclusion of partner-taken photos (default: TRUE).<br>
`-partner-album "partner's album"` import assets from partner into given album.<br>
`-keep-trashed <bool>` Determines whether to import trashed images (default: FALSE).<br>

### Example Usage: uploading a Google photos takeout archive

To illustrate, here's a command importing photos from a Google Photos takeout archive captured between June 1st and June 30th, 2019, while auto-generating albums:

```sh
./immich-go -server=http://mynas:2283 -key=zzV6k65KGLNB9mpGeri9n8Jk1VaNGHSCdoH1dY8jQ upload
-create-albums -google-photos -date=2019-06 ~/Download/takeout-*.zip             
```

## Command `duplicate`

Use this command for analyzing the content of your `immich` server to find any files that share the same file name, the  date of capture, but having different size. 
Before deleting the inferior copies, the system get all albums they belong to, and add the superior copy to them.

### Switches and options:
`-yes` Assume Yes to all questions (default: FALSE).<br> 
`-date` Check only assets have a date of capture in the given range. (default: 1850-01-04,2030-01-01)


### Example Usage: clean the `immich` server after having merged a google photo archive and original files

This command examine the immich server content, remove less quality images, and preserve albums.

NOTE: You should disable the dry run mode explicitly.

```sh
./immich-go -server=http://mynas:2283 -key=zzV6k65KGLNB9mpGeri9n8Jk1VaNGHSCdoH1dY8jQ duplicate -dry-run=false
```

# Release notes 

## Release next

### Fix #39: another problems with Takeout archives
Thank to @bobokun for sharing details.

I have reworked the Google takeout import to handle @bobokun case. Following cases are now handled:
- normal FILE.jpg.json -> FILE.jpg
- less normal FILE.**jp**.json -> FILE.jpg
- long names truncated FIL.json -> FIL**E**.jpg
- long name with number and truncated VERY-LONG-NAM(150).json -> VERY-LONG-NAM**E**(150).jpg
- duplicates names in same folder FILE.JPG(3).json -> FILE**(3)**.JPG
- edited images FILE.JSON -> FILE.JPG and FILE**-edited**.JPG



## Release 0.3.6
### Fix #40: Error 204 when deleting assets

## Release 0.3.5

### Fix #35: weird name cases in google photos takeout: truncated name or jp.json
Here are some weird cases found in takeout archives

example:
image title: 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🥲☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋😛😝😜🤪🤨🧐🤓😎🥸🤩🥳😏😒😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩🥺😢😭😤😠😡🤬🤯😳🥵🥶.jpg
image file: 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🥲☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋😛.jpg
json file: 😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🥲☺️😊😇🙂🙃😉😌😍🥰😘😗😙😚😋.json

example:
image title: PXL_20230809_203449253.LONG_EXPOSURE-02.ORIGINAL.jpg
image file: PXL_20230809_203449253.LONG_EXPOSURE-02.ORIGINA.jpg
json file: PXL_20230809_203449253.LONG_EXPOSURE-02.ORIGIN.json

example:
image title: 05yqt21kruxwwlhhgrwrdyb6chhwszi9bqmzu16w0 2.jpg
image file: 05yqt21kruxwwlhhgrwrdyb6chhwszi9bqmzu16w0 2.jpg
json file: 05yqt21kruxwwlhhgrwrdyb6chhwszi9bqmzu16w0 2.jp.json



### Fix #32: Albums contains album's images and all images having the same name
Once, I have a folder full of JSON files for an album, but it doesn't have any pictures. Instead, the pictures are in a folder organized by years. To fix this, I tried to match the JSON files with the pictures by their names.

The problem is that sometimes pictures have the same name in different years, so it's hard to be sure which picture goes with which JSON file. Because of this, created album contains image found in its folder, but also images having same name, taken in different years.

I decided to remove this feature. Now, if the image isn't found beside the JSON file, the JSON is ignored.


## Release 0.3.2, 0.3.3, 0.3.4
### Fix for #30 panic: time: missing Location in call to Time.In with release Windows_x86_64_0.3.1
Now handle correctly windows' timezone names even on windows.
Umm...

## Release 0.3.0 and 0.3.1
**Refactoring of Google Photo Takeout handling**

The takeout archive has flaws making the import task difficult and and error prone.
I have rewritten this part of the program to fix most of encountered error.

### google photos: can't find image of album #11 
Some image may miss from the album's folder. Those images files are located into the year folder. 
This fix looks for album images in the whole archive.

### photos with same name into the year folder #12 
Iphones and digital cameras produce images with the sequence number of 4 digits. This leads inevitably to have several images with the same number in the the year folder.

Google Photos disambiguates the files name by adding a counter at the end of the image file:
- IMG_3479.JPG
- IMG_3479(1).JPG
- IMG_3479(2).JPG

Surprisingly, matching JSON are named as 
- IMG_3479.JPG.json
- IMG_3479.JPG(1).json
- IMG_3479.JPG(2).json

This special case is now handled.

### Untitled albums are now handled correctly
Untitled albums now are named after the album's folder name.

This address partially the issue #19.

###  can't find the image with title "___", pattern: "___*.*": file does not exist: "___" #21 

The refactoring of the code don't use anymore a file pattern to find files in the archive. 
The image and the JSON file are quite identical, except for duplicate image (see #12) or when the file name is too long (how long is too long?).

Now, the program takes the image name, check if there is a JSON that matches, open it and use the title of the image to name the upload.

If the JSON isn't found, the image is uploaded with it's name in the archive, and with no date. Now all images are uploaded to immich, even when the JSON file is not found.

### MPG files not supported. #20 
Immich-go now accepts the same list of extension as the immich-server. This list is taken from the server source code.

### immich-go detects raw and jpg as duplicates #25 
The duplicate checker now uses the file name, its extension and the date of take to detect duplicates. 
So the system doesn't signal `IMG_3479.JPG` and `IMG_3479.CR2` as duplicate anymore.

### fix duplicate check before uploading #29
The date parsing now takes into account the time zone of the machine (ex: Europe/Paris). This handles correctly summer time and winter time. 
This isn't yet tested on Window or Mac machines.


## Release 0.2.3

- Improvement of duplicate command (issue#13)
  - `-yes` option to assume Yes to all questions
  - `-date` to limit the check to a a given date range

### Release 0.2.2
- improvement of date of capture when there isn't any exif data in the file
    1. test the file name for a date
    1. open the file and search for the date (.jpg, .mp4, .heic, .mov)
    1. if still not found, give the current date

> ⚠️ As of current version v1.77.0, immich fails to get the date of capture of some videos (IPhone), and place the video on the 01/01/1970.
> 
> You can use the -album to keep videos grouped in a same place despite the errors in date.

### Release 0.2.1
- Fix of -album option. uploaded images will be added into the album. Existing images will be added in the album if needed.

### Release 0.2.0
- When uploading from a directory, use the date inferred from the file name as file date.  Immich uses it as date of take. This is useful for images without Exif data.
- `duplicate` command check immich for several version of the same image, same file name, same date of capture
