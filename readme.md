# Uploader en masse for Immich

The Immich project meets with all for my requirements for managing my photos:
- Self hosted
- Open source
- Plenty of functionalities
- User experience very close from Google Photos.
- Machine learning
- Full API, documented
- ...

Now, I need to move my assets to the new system. en mass... 

I don't like the burden of installing nodejs and or docker on my laptop only for running the immich-CLI tool.

At the same time, I would like to improve my GO skills. Hence my little project.

This version is limited to assets in a local directory.
But it's is possible to extend it for:
- Importing from Google Phots takeout archive
- what else

Benefits of this implementation:
- No installation
- Multi-platform


The code is largely inspired by the official application https://github.com/immich-app/CLI.
